Search for evidence of water entering the structure. Undetected, mold issues may intensify till the point where aggressive remediation is the only recourse. With timely detection, however, sometimes the only response needed is extensive cleansing, drying, and perhaps some minor repair work to the structure.</p><p>Tip # 2 - Engage a mold expert to do a comprehensive inspection of the building.
